Acknowledgements to Albert Okine for answering a question on truncate, Stack Overflow for
ideas on implementing using string functions, and the Java documentation.

lab-polymorphism-2019
=====================

A lab on polymorphism, based on an old lab from _The Tao of Java_, itself
based on an even older lab from _Espresso_.  Old labs never die; they just
get recycled.
